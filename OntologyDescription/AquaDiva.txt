The AquaDiva ontology domain encompasses the study of groundwater ecosystems by integrating key fields such as hydrogeology, microbial ecology, geochemistry, karst systems, and environmental science. It supports the annotation and standardization of diverse datasets related to subsurface habitats, enabling a structured approach to understanding these complex systems. As a life science ontology, it focuses on the interactions between microbial communities, groundwater ecosystems, and geochemical processes, promoting the systematic study of groundwater environments and their biodiversity, chemical properties, and ecological dynamics. AquaDiva serves as a bridge between different scientific disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary research and data harmonization in subsurface ecosystems.
