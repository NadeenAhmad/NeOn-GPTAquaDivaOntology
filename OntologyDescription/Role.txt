The Role ontology within the AquaDiva domain defines and categorizes the various functions and interactions of both biological and chemical entities within groundwater ecosystems. It encompasses a range of biological roles, such as the activities of organisms and microbes, as well as chemical roles that influence the geochemistry of aquifers. Key functions include the roles of substances as poisons, inhibitors, or acceptors, which impact biological and chemical processes in subsurface environments. Additionally, it covers the influence of acids and environmental containment factors that shape the interactions between organisms and their habitat. This ontology is critical for understanding the functional roles that different species and chemical agents play within aquifer ecosystems.
