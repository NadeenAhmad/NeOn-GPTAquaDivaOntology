The Habitat ontology within the AquaDiva domain focuses on the diverse microbial and fungal ecosystems present in aquifer environments. It explores the interactions of aquifer fungi, aquatic microbes, and microbial functional guilds, and how they adapt to and influence their subsurface habitats. The ontology incorporates data on the chemical composition of aquifers, highlighting the relationship between aquifer chemical data and microbial activity. Additionally, it emphasizes the roles of aquatic fungi, heterotrophs, and rare microbial species within these environments, including unique processes like autolithoantatrophy. This framework is essential for understanding the ecological diversity and functionality of species that thrive in groundwater habitats, particularly those adapted to subsurface ecosystems.
