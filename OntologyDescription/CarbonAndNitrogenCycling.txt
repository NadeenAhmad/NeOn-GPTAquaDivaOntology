The Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling ontology within the AquaDiva domain focuses on the intricate processes governing carbon and nitrogen dynamics in groundwater ecosystems. It encompasses key biochemical pathways such as CO2 fixation pathways and rubisco, which are central to carbon cycling. The ontology also captures critical aspects of the nitrogen cycle, including ammonia-oxidizers, nitrogen leaching, denitrification, and denitrification processes. By integrating carbon and nitrogen isotopes, the ontology supports the analysis of these cycles, helping to understand CO2 fixation, energy metabolism, and the production and consumption of trace gases. This framework is crucial in investigating how carbon and nitrogen move through ecosystems, especially in forest environments like beech forests, where nitrogen leaching and carbon fixation significantly impact overall biogeochemical cycles.
